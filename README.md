# Noise Monitor Project
### About
When I arrived at Embecosm, on the first day of my work experience there, I was offered a real-world project surrounding a local church which is being used as a nursery for the local toddlers. The problem was that there had been many noise complaints surrounding the nursery, from the nearby residents.
