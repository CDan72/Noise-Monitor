# Noise Monitor Project

### About
When I arrived at Embecosm, on the first day of my work experience there, I was offered a real-world project surrounding a local church, which is being used as a nursery for the local toddlers. The problem was that there had been many noise complaints surrounding the nursery, from the nearby residents, and I was given the task of finding a way to keep track of the noise the children made during the day. I was asked to write a program which recorded the noise levels from 8am until 6pm on a Monday to Friday, weekly basis, and create a graph displaying the noise levels during those times. Lastly, I was asked to make it so the graph would auto-send to a Google Group for people to see and compare, to the other graphs, and the times of any future complaints.

### Day 1
On Monday the 8th of July, I visited the location of the nursery to see where I could set up a microphone, and where I could store a computer so that no one could tamper with it. I also sat down with the main client of the project to discuss: who was complaining; the best places to set up a microphone; what my program should do; where my program would be physically stored; what resources I had; and found out the usual times the children were allowed out to play. All this information I gathered has proven useful, and it has helped me with my project. Later on, I returned to the office, and tried to figure out which computer would fit the requirements I needed; in the end I settled with a Raspberry Pi 3. I finished my first day with a good idea of what I had to do, I just needed to figure out how to do it.
